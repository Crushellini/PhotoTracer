#PhotoTracer

PhotoTracer fetches stock photos using the Pixabay API and allows you to draw on top of them with a canvas element. You leave the search terms empty to get a random picture or you can enter a query to narrow down your search.
This app is intended to be a tool for artists to use to practice drawing by tracing over images.
